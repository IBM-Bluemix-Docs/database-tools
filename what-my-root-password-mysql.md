# What is my root password for MySQL?

* If the server was auto-provisioned with {{site.data.keyword.mysql}}, the root password is the same as the server root password.
* If Plesk is auto-provisioned on your server, use "admin" and the admin password for Plesk.
* If you installed {{site.data.keyword.mysql}} through source, RPM, or up2date, then the initial root account passwords are empty. Anyone can connect to the {{site.data.keyword.mysql}} server as root without a password and be granted all privileges, unless you set the root password during or after the {{site.data.keyword.mysql}} installation.
