# MongoDB

{{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} is a fully featured NoSQL server that is horizontally scalable to meet your enterprise class database service needs. {{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} can be ordered at no cost in the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_full}} shopping cart or requested with an OS reload. Currently, the following operating systems are supported:

* CentOS 6.x
* RHEL 6.x
* Ubuntu 12.04
* Debian 6.x

Notes for a SL-MongoDB installation:

* By default, Mongod (the {{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} service) is bound only to your private network interface. {{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} is provisioned with a pre-configured administrative user. The username is _admin_ and the password the same as the server root password.
* If you order a {{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} Solution, like a replica set cluster, then your admin password is set on all {{site.data.keyword.mongodb}} servers in the solution at the end of the cluster configuration process.
