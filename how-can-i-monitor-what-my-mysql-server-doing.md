# How can I monitor my MySQL server?

_mytop_, a handy little Linux application is a near-time monitor (similar to the UNIX utility 'top') that specifically looks at what the {{site.data.keyword.mysql}} server is doing. _mytop_ updates every few seconds so you can get a reasonable look at your SQL performance. _mytop_ is also capable of displaying a huge amount of information. It also assumes that you're connecting to the {{site.data.keyword.mysql}} server on localhost with the root user and no password. Credentials can be changed either in the script itself or on the command line.
